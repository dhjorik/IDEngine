# Notes 000 - Introduction  
The goal of this project is to understand how Chocolate DOOM engine works, I will be testing my implementation using the assets released with the DOOM Shareware and Ultimate DOOM ([steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/Ultimate_Doom/)). I will be including the shareware WAD with the source code.  

I will be sharing all my notes and my finding, I'm not looking to squeeze performance with my code, I hope to get a working version and later tune and optimize it.    

I'm not a graphics/game programming, so if you spot an error you're welcome to correct me, suggest changes, or share your concerns and views. You can open an issue or ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AngryCPPCoder)

Here is a list of resources and references.  
[Graphics Programming Black Book By Michael Abrash](https://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/graphics-programming-black-book/184404919) (Chapters 59, 60, 61, 62)  
[Game Engine Black Book: DOOM by Fabien Sanglard](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Engine-Black-Book-Doom/dp/1987418433) This is one of the best books that dive into DOOM internals.

[Chocolate Doom Source Code](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom)  

### Requirements  
* Visual Studio: Any IDE should work; I will use Visual Studio 2017.  
* SDL2: Libraries (will include with source).  

### Optional  
* DOOM: A copy of Ultimate DOOM steam version, we will only need the WAD file.  
* Slade3: This will be a good tool to verify some of our work.  

### Thoughts  
I don't know if I can complete this project, but I will try my best. I always believe I can.  
My target platform will be windows, but since I'm using SDL, it should be easy to get this to work under other platforms.  

### Special Thanks
Through this journey, a handful of people has reached out to me pointing me to mistakes or even rewriting paragraphs of my notes, I canâ€™t thank them enough! Sharing your knowledge doesn't take anything from you, and remember we are looking into DOOM code just because John Carmack shared his knowledge by open sourcing DOOM!
