# Notes 007 - BSP Node
BSP (binary space partitioning), is just a tree that breaks down a map into small pieces (sub-sectors) and stores them in a form of tree nodes so it is easy to search for a sub-sector and look at neighboring sub-sectors. When the map is created by the designer it gets processed to generate its BSP tree before the map could be used in game. Let's have a high overview of how this BSP tree could be visualized.  

Let's take E1M1 as an example  

![E1M1](./img/BSP1.png)  

A splitter is chosen, and then everything is on the right or the left of that splitter. 
The right and left are based on the direction of the first vertex moving to the second vertex (mathematically called vector, the direction you go moving to the second point). 
Note: left and right are depended on the splitter direction, and not "your" left and right.  

A spelter/vector moving upwards can be illustrated as following

![Vector up](./img/vector_up.png)  

But a vector moving the downward look like this

![Vector down](./img/vector_down.png)  

Note: when you see left or right take a second and think what is the direction of motion, and try to imagine your facing that direction, to get left and right correctly. 

So, the first splitter in E1M1 is point (2176, -2304), with change in X = 0 and change in Y = -256 (line is moving down). This makes the right of the line to the left and left to the right.  

![E1M1 BSP2](./img/BSP2.png)  

In this image the splitter is the small blue line, the left green box is the right and the red box is the left.  

Each one of those boxes is split to the smaller right and left boxes (forming the tree).

This will go all the way until we have a "sub-sector" which is a convex polygon (we will dig deep into that later).  
The node structure in the WAD has a lot of data stored in it. A node is a sub-sector leaf node if the last bit is set to 1 (a leaf node, indicating that this node is a sub-sector and it will not have more children). 

For now, we will not use this information, but it is critical to figure out the type of the node we are looking at.  
Something to note here, you can see how a developers back then would utilize every single bit they could, nowadays (and I'm doing that myself) just allocate memory all over the place.  

In my professional life, I have seen how much performance was impacted because developers was too lazy and were just copying variables over and over for function calls (An HTML parser that took 10 sec with passing variables by value over and over dropped down to 3 sec when the code was just changed to pass pointer around).    

## Goals
1. Read the Node structure  
   
## Design
So, at this point we just need to read the nodes of map BSP tree, the nodes are sorted into an array (and we will store them in an array format), the index is needed to access the children of a node.  
So, let's get started

### Node Data Format  
| Field Size | Data Type                            | Content                                          |  
|------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|  
| 0x00-0x01  | Partition line x coordinate          | X coordinate of the splitter                     |  
| 0x02-0x03  | Partition line y coordinate          | Y coordinate of the splitter                     |   
| 0x04-0x05  | Change in x to end of partition line | The amount to move in X to reach end of splitter |  
| 0x06-0x07  | Change in y to end of partition line | The amount to move in Y to reach end of splitter |  
| 0x08-0x09  | Right box top                        | First corner of right box (Y coordinate)         |  
| 0x0A-0x0B  | Right box bottom                     | Second corner of right box (Y coordinate)        |  
| 0x0C-0x0D  | Right box left                       | First corner of right box (X coordinate)         |  
| 0x0E-0x0F  | Right box right                      | Second corner of right box (X coordinate)        |  
| 0x10-0x11  | Left box top                         | First corner of left box (Y coordinate)          |  
| 0x12-0x13  | Left box bottom                      | Second corner of left box (Y coordinate)         |  
| 0x14-0x15  | Left box left                        | First corner of left box (X coordinate)          |  
| 0x16-0x17  | Left box right                       | Second corner of left box (X coordinate)         |  
| 0x18-0x19  | Right child index                    | Index of the right child + sub-sector indicator  |  
| 0x1A-0x1B  | Left child index                     | Index of the left child + sub-sector indicator   |  

A lot of data, but there are few interesting things to be noted here. 
* The splitter is stored as a single point, then the delta in X and Y to the second point. This is an optimization which we will talk about when we start traversing the BSP node.
* Why in the world would he need to store the right box and the Left box of a splitter? After digging a little bit into the code, it is another brilliant optimization (sadly we will not use for now, but we will cover how it works). On the other had these boxes are used in all those screen shoots to show the right and left of the splitter.

## Coding
So, nothing is new here, again just the same old task, reading the node data from the WAD.  

Adding our struct that will hold the data  

``` cpp
struct Node
{
    int16_t XPartition;
    int16_t YPartition;
    int16_t ChangeXPartition;
    int16_t ChangeYPartition;

    int16_t RightBoxTop;
    int16_t RightBoxBottom;
    int16_t RightBoxLeft;
    int16_t RightBoxRight;

    int16_t LeftBoxTop;
    int16_t LeftBoxBottom;
    int16_t LeftBoxLeft;
    int16_t LeftBoxRight;

    uint16_t RightChildID;
    uint16_t LeftChildID;
};
```
Update Map.h to hold the nodes  

``` cpp
 std::vector<Node> m_Nodes;
```

If you haven't noticed yet, the map is becoming a mess! I promise to refactor this but not yet, as soon as I get some 3D drawn on the window, I will clean all of this.  

Adding a function that will read the data based on their size.  

``` cpp
void WADReader::ReadNodesData(const uint8_t *pWADData, int offset, Node &node)
{
    node.XPartition = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset);
    node.YPartition = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 2);
    node.ChangeXPartition = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 4);
    node.ChangeYPartition = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 6);

    node.RightBoxTop = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 8);
    node.RightBoxBottom = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 10);
    node.RightBoxLeft = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 12);
    node.RightBoxRight = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 14);

    node.LeftBoxTop = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 16);
    node.LeftBoxBottom = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 18);
    node.LeftBoxLeft = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 20);
    node.LeftBoxRight = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 22);

    node.RightChildID = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 24);
    node.LeftChildID = Read2Bytes(pWADData, offset + 26);
}
```

Now it is time to read the Node from the WAD.  

``` cpp
bool WADLoader::ReadMapNodes(Map *pMap)
{
    int iMapIndex = FindMapIndex(pMap);

    if (iMapIndex == -1)
    {
        return false;
    }

    iMapIndex += EMAPLUMPSINDEX::eNODES;

    if (strcmp(m_WADDirectories[iMapIndex].LumpName, "NODES") != 0)
    {
        return false;
    }

    int iNodesSizeInBytes = sizeof(Node);
    int iNodesCount = m_WADDirectories[iMapIndex].LumpSize / iNodesSizeInBytes;

    Node node;
    for (int i = 0; i < iNodesCount; ++i)
    {
        m_Reader.ReadNodesData(m_WADData, m_WADDirectories[iMapIndex].LumpOffset + i * iNodesSizeInBytes, node);

        pMap->AddNode(node);
    }

    return true;
}
```

The root node is the last node, let's read that and draw the splitter, right and left box.  

``` cpp
void Map::RenderAutoMapNode()
{
    // Get the last node
    Node node = m_Nodes[m_Nodes.size()-1];

    SDL_Rect RightRect = {
        RemapXToScreen(node.RightBoxLeft),
        RemapYToScreen(node.RightBoxTop),
        RemapXToScreen(node.RightBoxRight) - RemapXToScreen(node.RightBoxLeft) + 1,
        RemapYToScreen(node.RightBoxBottom)- RemapYToScreen(node.RightBoxTop) + 1
    };

    SDL_Rect LeftRect = {
        RemapXToScreen(node.LeftBoxLeft),
        RemapYToScreen(node.LeftBoxTop),
        RemapXToScreen(node.LeftBoxRight) - RemapXToScreen(node.LeftBoxLeft) + 1,
        RemapYToScreen(node.LeftBoxBottom) - RemapYToScreen(node.LeftBoxTop) + 1
    };

    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(m_pRenderer, 0, 255, 0, SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE); 
    SDL_RenderDrawRect(m_pRenderer, &RightRect);
    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(m_pRenderer, 255, 0, 0, SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE);
    SDL_RenderDrawRect(m_pRenderer, &LeftRect);

    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(m_pRenderer, 0, 0, 255, SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE);
    SDL_RenderDrawLine(m_pRenderer,
        RemapXToScreen(node.XPartition),
        RemapYToScreen(node.YPartition),
        RemapXToScreen(node.XPartition + node.ChangeXPartition),
        RemapYToScreen(node.YPartition + node.ChangeYPartition));
}
```

## Other Notes  
So, looking at the original/Chocolate Doom port, the function P_LoadNodes in p_setup.c is the one that loads the BSP nodes. The function  allocates an array of memory and for loops loading the nodes from the WAD.  

The screen shots I took utilized the right and left box in the node, it is nice to play around and draw boxes by changing the index of the node you read
``` cpp
Node node = m_Nodes[m_Nodes.size()-1]; // try  m_Nodes[131]
```

it will give a better understanding of how things are broken down.
